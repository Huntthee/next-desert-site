# :hammer:  React w/ Next.js & TypeScript rebuild of TheDesertWhale's Art & Commission website :wrench:

*Project by Mike Allison (Huntthee)*

---

## What's going on here!?
I am rebuilding a site first constructed with `EJS/Node` & hosted on `Heroku`, and creating it basically anew with `React/Next.js/TypeScript` and `Tailwind CSS` with hosting by `Vercel` once completed. Most of the actual content has been copy pasta'd right on over.

What needs to be rebuilt or built from scratch is some of the logic for injecting HTML/JSX such as with the `waitlist` and the `portfolio` pages.

## What's been done so far?

- [x] Set up Next.js project
- [x] Convert to TypeScript
- [x] Copy/Paste site content
- [x] Install & Configure Tailwind
- [x] Create logic for populating `portfolio` page with images/text about past projects
- [x] Apply basic global styles
- [x] Apply basic mobile styles

## Coming up next

- [ ] Begin work on desktop styles
- [ ] implement 'night-mode' features
- [ ] polish & finalize mobile styles
- [ ] polish & finalize desktop styles
- [ ] Possibly move waitlist & portfolio logic into waitlist component, populate tables with React instead :beetle:.


## What the future holds

Eventually I hope to have this site more or less replicate the existing site at [www.TheDesertWhale.com](https://www.thedesertwhale.com) but with additional features such as Dark Mode made easy with Tailwind.
