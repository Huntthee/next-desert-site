        <h1>Policy and Terms of Service</h1>
        <h3>General Working Policy, Please Read Carefully!</h3>
        <h3>By commissioning me, you acknowledge and agree to the terms stated below.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I work Monday to Friday</li>
          <li>Email as the primary form of contact unless told otherwise.</li>
          <li>Please do not ask me to copy or replicate another artists style or image.</li>
          <li>ALL files will be PNG, sized according to the commission requirements.</li>
          <li>I do not do vector illustrations for regular commissions. If you require a higher resolution image, different sizes, resolutions, prefer RGB vs CMYK, or intend to use it for merchandising please let me know before I start, as this will be considered a special request and may come with additional charges.</li>
          <li>The Client MUST provide as much information and visual reference as possible, if I am required to do research, you will be charged hourly for me having to do so. If I am expected to come up with an entire image based on very little to no information or references an additional charge for Character Design will be added on top of the original commission fee.</li>
          <li>Two revisions are included for every piece of work, one after the preliminary design and one at the final stages of design. Any additional, excessive changes will be charged by the hour @ $20/hr. I send drafts during this process for revision purposes only. Please do not save or upload them to social media.</li>
          <li>Payment accepted through PayPal <strong>ONLY</strong>.</li>
          <li>I work on My time, it ensures the best results. If you want me to work on your time, rush a commission or move your project to the front of the line I require 100% payment upfront. Rush Orders adds 50% of the cost to your order. 50% of the total commission payment will be treated as a nonrefundable deposit and ensure your spot in line. Work will only start once payment has been received.</li>
          <li>I ask that you credit me appropriately for the final product when/where such credit may be reasonably provided. I must also be allowed to display the work in a portfolio or on social media for personal marketing purposes at an agreed time after the completion of the project.</li>
          <li>I reserve all rights of reproduction and all copyrights to the commission, the preliminary design, and any incidental work made in the creation of the commission. You can purchase the rights to the commission at an added cost that can be discussed during the commission process.</li>
          <li>I am not responsible for the content on your website or pages, or for how you choose to upload the images once I have finished them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Client Is Allowed To:</h3>

          <li>Make stickers out of the commission for personal use.</li>
          <li>Claim the rights to their character/s in the piece, not the piece itself.</li>

        <h3>Refunds, Cancellations, Ownership & Copyright.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Full or even partial refunds are not available if the client is unhappy with the finished product. We go over everything during 2 revision processes, all issues should be resolved before the commission has been completed so that the client is happy with the finished piece. All additional revisions will be charged hourly, @ $20/hr.</li>
          <li>I, the artist, reserve rights to terminate the agreement in the event the Client is more than 30 days late in payment.</li>
          <li>I reserve the rights to move onto other work/projects and the Client may lose their place in line, if they take more than 3 days to respond to questions/messages regarding the commission.</li>
          <li>Title of the commission remains with me until I am paid in full.</li>
          <li>Again, I do not offer vector illustrations for regular commissions. Please be fully aware of that fact before filing for a refund. If you have not specified to me the file format or other details before I have started the commission process, refunds will not even be considered.</li>
          <li>If the contract is terminated for whatever reason, the rights to the commission remain with me, and the work can be sold to another customer.</li>
