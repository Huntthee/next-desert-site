            I do not do vector illustrations for regular commissions. If you
            require a higher resolution image, different sizes, resolutions,
            prefer RGB vs CMYK, or intend to use it for merchandising please let
            me know before I start, as this will be considered a special request
            and may come with additional charges.
          </li>

            The Client MUST provide as much information and visual reference as
            possible, if I am required to do research, you will be charged
            hourly for me having to do so. If I am expected to come up with an
            entire image based on very little to no information or references an
            additional charge for Character Design will be added on top of the
            original commission fee.

          <li className="xl:ml-4">
            Two revisions are included for every piece of work, one after the
            preliminary design and one at the final stages of design. Any
            additional, excessive changes will be charged by the hour @ $20/hr.
            I send drafts during this process for revision purposes only. Please
            do not save or upload them to social media.

            work on your time, rush a commission or move your project to the

            50% of the cost to your order. 50% of the total commission payment
            will be treated as a nonrefundable deposit and ensure your spot in
